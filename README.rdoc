== RTBench

RTBench is intended to fairly and openly compare popular Ruby (and Rails) 
template engines.  This is accomplished by setting up a standard set of 
benchmarks and running them several times across multiple template engines.

=== Current benchmarks

This application currently benchmarks the following engines:

* ERB[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/]
* Liquid[http://www.liquidmarkup.org/]
* HAML[http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/]

The following activities are tested in each engine:

Accessing attributes:: Take an object and output an attribute
Looping:: Loop over a set of objects and output an attribute for each object
Filtering:: Perform a manipulation of a variable value (time formatting)
Conditionals (Simple):: Run a simple conditional and output an attribute
Conditionals (Complex):: Run a multi-test conditional and output an attribute

=== How to run

Although this is a Rails framework, the benchmarks are run outside of a 
running server application.  Instead, in the root of the checkout directory:

  ruby bench.rb  # or just
  ./bench.rb
